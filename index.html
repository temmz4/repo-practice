        <p id="para1">I am a 26 year old nigerian-american currently living in New Jersey. I was born in Florida during the year 1996.
        However, soon after I was born my parents decided to take mys two older siblings and I back to New Jersey.
        Within 3 years of living in New Jersey my parents decided to have another child. December 15, 1999 my younger sister was born,
        and thus bringing the total family unit to account for 4 children and 2 adults.

        <p class="paragrp">I am somewhat of a gamer, a lover of hip-hop music, an avid anime and manga consumer, a writer, and sooner or later I'll be calling myself a techie!
        I've been surrounded by technology my entire life so it was only a matter of time before I realized how interested I am in all things tech related.
        In all honesty, having the knowledge to be able to communicate with technology is a major flex. The most rewarding work never comes easy.</p>
        <p class="paragrp"> Technology is integrated into practically everything I see and use so during these next 15 weeks I'll be extremely excited being able to absorb all the knowledge I can.
